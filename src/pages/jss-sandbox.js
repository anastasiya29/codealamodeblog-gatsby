          I am a Sitecore and JavaScript developer who is currently learning the
          Sitecore JavaScript Services (JSS) SDK. My goal is to build a small
          sandbox site where I can explore JSS features and try out the API. I
          want to take typical challenges that developers encounter on projects
          and explore how they are handled in the JSS world.

            My plan was to start out in <code>disconnected</code> mode, and then
            switch over to <code>connected</code> mode once I had the data
            modeling and presentation figured out, since I think this is the
            most likely workflow for JavaScript developers. So, I started by
            creating a new JSS React app by following the steps in the&nbsp;

            &nbsp;taught me to use the <code>jss scaffold</code> command to
            generate new components. I was interested in learning how this
            command worked so that I could customize the component template to
            my style. This customization was straightforward to achieve, see the
            following post for details.

          <h2 data-step-id="3">Mastering the manifest API</h2>
          <p>
            Building a Sitecore site requires designing components, routes, and
            custom route types based on the siteâ€™s content and UX requirements.
            In a traditional MVC implementation, this data modeling is done by
            creating items in the Sitecore tree. But in a JSS implementation,
            when using a <code>disconnected</code>, <code>code-first</code>
            workflow, this data modeling is done by passing data to JavaScript
            functions via the manifest API. The following post is a deep dive
            into understanding the <code>manifest API</code>.

            This post shows how I used the manifest API to create a custom route

          <p>
            Similar to disconnected mode, connected development mode also runs
            your JSS app on a local server. The difference is that in
            disconnected mode the app is hydrated with content from yaml/json
            files, but in connected mode the app is hydrated with content from
            Sitecore.
          </p>
          <p>
            To run connected mode, I needed to deploy my app to Sitecore, which
            did not go smoothly. This post covers the errors I experienced and
            how I solved them.

            Externalizing reusable JSS components into a library

          <p>
            Component reuse is an important subject for developers. As I was
            building structural grid components for my JSS app, I thought,
            &quot;all projects need grid components, so is it possible to
            package these up for reuse?&quot; So I set out to create a POC of
            the idea. This post shares how I published JSS components as an npm
            package that can be imported into other JSS projects.
